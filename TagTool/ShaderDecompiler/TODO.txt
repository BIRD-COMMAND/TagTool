Fully reverse Microcode Directives from 'PixelShaderReference.ConstantData byte[]' and
'VertexShaderReference.ConstantData byte[]' in \TagTool\Shaders\ (probably best to create a new instruction type to 
hold their data, even though they aren't actual instructions.)

Figure out destination register masking, absolute value on source operands, various others.
